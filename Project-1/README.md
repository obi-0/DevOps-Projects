# LAMP STACK IMPLEMENTATION

LAMP STACK is a set of open source software used to develop web application.
A web application requires an operating system, a web server, a database and a programming language to function efficently.

The programs i used for this project are:

1. Linux - Operating system
2. Apache - Web server
3. MySQL - Database
4. PHP - Programming language

To complete this project, i created an AWS account, setup and configured an EC2 instance with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM).

I used MobaXterm Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) to establish connection with my Ubuntu server.
